    "climate":"Sri Lanka, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, boasts a climate as diverse as its landscapes. The country experiences a tropical climate with distinct wet and dry seasons, influenced by two monsoons. The southwest monsoon, from May to September, brings abundant rainfall to the southwestern regions, including the lush hills and tea plantations. In contrast, the northeast monsoon, from November to February, affects the northern and eastern coasts. Coastal areas enjoy a sun-kissed climate year-round, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. The central highlands, with cities like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, offer a refreshing escape with cooler temperatures and occasional mist. Sri Lanka's climate fosters diverse ecosystems, from rainforests to arid zones, providing a picturesque backdrop to the island's rich cultural tapestry and vibrant wildlife."
